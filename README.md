# polynomial-Calculator
polynomial of one indeterminate Calculator in C .Basic operation Like '+', '-', '*', '/'.

Input the first number and index(if number =0 ,end)
5 3 -2 1 0    // means : 5x^3-2x
Input the operator:
+
Input the second number and index(if number =0 ,end)
6 6 -5 5 -2 3 2 2 1 1 10 0 0  //means: 6x^6-5x^5-2x^3+2x^2+x+10

answer:
6.0x^6.0-5.0x^5.0+3.0x^3.0+2.0x^2.0-1.0x^1.0+10.0

but if operator is '/',the second number would be one number and one index.Like 2x^2;
